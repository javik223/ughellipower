				Electrical Safety Tips</h2>
			<ul class="list">
				<li>
					<strong>Keep away from transformers.</strong></li>
				<li>
					<strong>Never attempt to open the door of one of these transformers.</strong> If you find a door unlocked, call the nearest PHCN service station.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Look up!</strong> Always examine your surroundings for power line locations before doing any outside work.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Be cautious on the roof.</strong> Working on a roof may put you close to an overhead power line. Avoid standing up and accidentally touching a line with your head or shoulder.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Do not plant vegetation</strong> to grow up or near utility poles or live wires.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Be aware when moving farm equipment.</strong> Stay clear of overhead power lines when moving or storing farm equipments. Metals and wet objects conduct eletricity.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Do not throw objects up into power lines.</strong> This can cause short circuits and could result in injuries. This includes items you might not consider conductive, like ropes and strings</li>
				<li>
					<strong>See something tangled in a power line? Stay clear.</strong> Never attempt to move an object from a power line yourself. Never climb the pole. Call any PHCN service station - they can help</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Never touch a downed power line.</strong> If you see a downed power line, contact your local PHCN service station immediately. Don&rsquo;t touch the line or anything that is in contact with it. Don&rsquo;t attempt to move the line. Keep others away, and consider every wire on the ground to be energized and dangerous.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Obey warning signs.</strong> &ldquo;DANGER: HIGH VOLTAGE&rdquo; and other warning signs are posted in some locations. But remember, all electrical equipment can be dangerous.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Substations are not playgrounds.</strong> At neighborhood substations, high-voltage electricity is reduced to be sent to homes. Don&#39;t climb over or crawl under substation fences, walls or gates. If a ball or toy goes over a fence and into a substation, call the nearest PHCN office. We will come and get it out for you.</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Stay inside during storms.</strong> When there is lightning outdoors, get inside a building or car if possible. Keep away from windows and open doors</li>
