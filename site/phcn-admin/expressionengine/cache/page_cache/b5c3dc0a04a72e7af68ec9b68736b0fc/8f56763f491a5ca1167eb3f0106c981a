						<p>Transnational Corporation of Nigeria (Transcorp) has emerged the most compliant firm among the companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE).&nbsp; The Most Complaint Listed Firm award is given by the NSE to the company that demonstrates the highest degree of compliance with the rules and regulations&nbsp; regarding disclosure obligations of listed companies to the exchange in&nbsp; particular year.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hopes of&nbsp; the shareholders of Transcorp&nbsp; to receive another dividend at the end of the 2014&nbsp; financial year have been raised last as the company posted a jump of 89 per cent in profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transcorp reported&nbsp; profit before tax of N9.7 billion, up by 89 per cent from N5.15 billion in the corresponding period of 2013, while profit after tax improved by from N3.5billion to N8.263 billion.&nbsp; Total assets stood at N157 billion compared with N149.454 billion as at December as at December 31, 2103.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Commenting on the results, the&nbsp; Chief Executive Officer, Transcorp Plc, Mr. Emmanuel Nnorom said, &ldquo;Our third quarter 2014 results underscore our determination to achieve our full year&nbsp; 2014 targets. Our commitment to excellence is evident in the significant achievements we have recorded this year in our power and hospitality businesses.&rdquo;</p>

						<p>Agreements will dramatically increase capacity at the Ughelli power plant in 2014</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lagos, 30 January 2014 &ndash; Transcorp Ughelli Power Ltd (TUPL), the power subsidiary of Transnational Corporation of Nigeria Plc (Transcorp), and General Electric (GE) have signed an agreement to expand the capacity of TUPL&rsquo;s Ughelli power plant by1000MW over the next 3 to 5 years.</p>

<p>Both parties have also signed a separate agreement to rehabilitate the damaged GT 15 turbine at the Ughelli plant, which will add 115MW to the plant&rsquo;s output.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently, the Transcorp Ughelli power plant generates 360MW of electricity, up from 160MW on November 1, when Transcorp took ownership of the plant. With the additional 115MW, as well as other rehabilitation works planned at the plant, output at Ughelli will increase to 700MW by December 2014.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ughelli power plant is Nigeria&rsquo;s largest gas-fired electricity generation asset.&nbsp; Purchased by Transcorp during the 2013power privatization programme, the $300 million plant is part of the $2.5 billion investment pledge made by the Chairman of Transcorp and Heirs Holdings, Tony O. Elumelu, CON, to deliver affordable, accessible power to Africa under the Power Africa Initiative. Heirs Holdings, Elumelu&rsquo;s pan-African proprietary investment company, is Power Africa&rsquo;s largest private sector investor and a major investor in Transcorp.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The agreements were signed at a closed door meeting between executives of both companies, led by Elumelu and&nbsp;the Global Chairman of General Electric, Jeffrey Immelt. They follow a cooperation agreement executed by Transcorp and GE in 2013.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Commenting, Elumelu said, &ldquo;We are verypleased to work with GE, a proven world leader in power technology development,on the Ughelli plant expansion project.&nbsp; With this, we&rsquo;ve taken a bold step in fulfilling our promise to Transcorp&rsquo;s stakeholders and the people of Nigeria. In a very short period of time, we have achieved significant impact - power production has more than doubled, andwith this agreement, we will see increased output before the end of this year. We are confident that this partnership with GE will further accelerate the achievement of our goals in the power sector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Immelt said,&ldquo;GE fully appreciates the confidence expressed by Transcorp. We are happy to bring the considerable resources of GE to support Transcorp&rsquo;s audacious vision for Nigeria&rsquo;s Power industry. This partnership with Transcorp underlines GE&rsquo;s deep commitment to developing the Nigerian power sector.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A publicly listed conglomerate with strategic investments in the power, hospitality, business and energy sectors, Transcorp, through TUPL, is committed to transform and&nbsp;bring the plant to profitability by increasing its generating capacity to&nbsp;impact positively on the socio-economic development of Nigeria.</p>

					<h2 class="subhead_dark bigger">Transcorp Delivers on Promise to Give Nigerians Access ...</h2>

						<p><br />
Dear Fellow Shareholder,<br />
You will recall that your Company recently raised additional capital, through a Rights Issue, in order to accelerate our bold growth strategy.<br />
I am writing to thank you for your support and to report that we are already seeing the first fruits of our plans to deliver value. Significant&nbsp;recent successes include:</p>

<p>The acquisition of the 1000MW capacity Ughelli Power Plc through our subsidiary &mdash; Transcorp Ughelli Power Ltd (TUPL). TUPL&nbsp;paid $300m for 100% ownership of the Plant. On November 1, 2013, TUPL successfully took over ownership and physical&nbsp;possession of the plant. We will significantly raise output, from the current 160MW to at least 1,500MW, over the next 3-5 years.&nbsp;With a&nbsp;dedicated pipeline supplying gas to the plant and a long term off-take agreement, with the Bulk Electricity Trader, the return profile of&nbsp;this investment is compelling. The potential impact of the investment on Transcorp&#39;s fortunes is significant. Equally important is the&nbsp;impact of secure and sustainable power generation on the living standards of all Nigerians. We are proud of the leading role that your&nbsp;company is able to play in the transformation of a sector critical to enabling Nigeria achieve her true potential.</p>

<p>The signing of an agreement with Hilton Worldwide, to commence the development of a 300 room five-star hotel in Ikoyi, Lagos,&nbsp;complementing our flagship Transcorp Hilton in Abuja. This project will be the first of eight internationally-branded hotels, that we&nbsp;plan to build over the next five years. Construction will begin in Q1 2014 and will be completed within 30 months. We have also&nbsp;completed the acquisition of a site in Port Harcourt for the development of another 300 room five star hotel. We expect to sign the&nbsp;management agreement in Q1 2014 and commence construction by the second quarter. Nigeria is dramatically underserved in the&nbsp;hospitality sector, and we see many opportunities to bring world class facilities to our guests from home and abroad.</p>

<p>We also commenced the renovation and upgrade of the Transcorp Hilton, Abuja, Nigeria&#39;s premier five-star hotel. As well as a&nbsp;dramatic transformation of our existing facilities, this project will also see the addition of a 5,000 seat capacity conference facility and&nbsp;200 serviced luxury apartments to the hotel, firmly cementing our position as the destination venue in the Nation&#39;s capital, Abuja.</p>

<p>The commencement of production of orange, mango and pineapple concentrates from the Teragro-Benfruit plant in Makurdi, Benue&nbsp;State. In October 2013, the plant received the ISO 9001:2008 (Quality Management System) and FSSC 22000:2005 (Food Safety&nbsp;Management System) certifications, illustrating that our products and processes meet the highest global standards. We plan to&nbsp;significantly increase the size and scope of this business. Teragro is the only juice concentrate producer in Nigeria and we are creating a&nbsp;fully integrated agro-allied business, ensuring that value added processing occurs here in Nigeria.</p>

<p>We continue to develop our oil and gas strategy, with our existing oil block, OPL 281, expected to begin production before the end of&nbsp;2014. We have put in place a world class management team and are committed to developing the synergies between our natural&nbsp;resources portfolio and our power interests, creating an integrated energy approach that directly links Nigeria&#39;s natural resource wealth&nbsp;to the daily needs of our people.</p>

<p>These successes, which are the products of the recent transformation in your company, will begin to contribute to our bottom line from&nbsp;November 2013. We were delighted to announce that in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013, your company recorded profits&nbsp;before tax of N5.1bn, a 30% increase over the total profit for the whole of the 2012 financial year.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Looking forward, your Company will continue to create and grow value in our chosen core business areas of Oil &amp; Gas, Power,&nbsp;Agriculture and Hospitality, through strategic investments, acquisitions and business turn around under pinned by our watchwords of&nbsp;Execution, Excellence, and Entrepreneurship.<br />
Likewise, we remain committed to identifying and transforming underperforming businesses, in other sectors, which we believe are&nbsp;critical to our nation&#39;s growth.<br />
We thank our current, over 300,000 strong, indigenous shareholders, for their support and look forward to welcoming many more to join&nbsp;in our success. We will not relent in positioning Transcorp as a true vehicle for popular participation in Nigeria&#39;s bright future and&nbsp;prosperity.<br />
Tony O. Elumelu, CON<br />
Chairman<br />

&nbsp;<br />
Vice President Namadi Sambo, GCON, FNIA who was represented by Mr. Emeka Wogu, the Honorable Minister for Labour and Productivity said: &lsquo;This handover ceremony is the culmination of 14 years of painstaking efforts by the NCP and its Secretariat, the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE), the Federal Ministry of Power and other key stakeholders to reform and liberalize Nigeria&rsquo;s electricity industry. This reform and privatization programme is rightly focused on the big picture, that is, the impact on the economy as a whole and ultimately, the greatest good for the greatest number of Nigerians. I congratulate Transcorp for emerging as the successful winner through a very rigorous, competitive and transparent process. We appreciate your faith in the process and your faith in the Nigerian Government and economy.&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Ughelli Power Plc, operator of the Ughelli Power Plant is one of the six power generation companies unbundled from the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN).

&nbsp;<br />
Tony O. Elumelu, CON, Chairman of Transcorp, while commenting on the successful handover ceremony remarked:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would like to thank the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan for their diligence towards achieving this significant milestone in the history of the Nigerian power sector.&rsquo; He added that Transcorp and its partners Tenoil, Symbion Power, Thomassen and Woodrock Energy are well positioned and have the required expertise to operate a world-class power generation plant that will transform the Nigerian Power sector and change the lives of its citizens.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Mr. Elumelu further re-stated Transcorp&rsquo;s unflagging commitment to invest in host communities wherever the organization operates with the aim of creating jobs, providing training and ensuring vital knowledge and skills transfer where possible thus ensuring sustainable contribution to Nigeria&rsquo;s economic and social development . &lsquo;We will actively engage the local communities in and around Ughelli to work together with the unified objective of ensuring that lives are improved and our larger economy revived.&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Adeoye Fadeyibi, the Chief Executive Officer of TUPL affirmed that the Power sector reform of the Federal Government has indeed created the right platform for sustainable economic development in Nigeria.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This is just the beginning of greater things to come. TUPL is poised to positively impact on the socio-economic development of Nigeria by improving living standards through regular and adequate power supply. We will increase the power generation of the plant from 300MW to over 1500MW in the next five years and we have the requisite capacity in finance and human capital to achieve our strategy.<br />
